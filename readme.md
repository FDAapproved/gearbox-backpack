# Gear Boxes.
A spiritual successor to the original Gear Crate mod by Silent Darkness. This mod adds Gear Boxes, backpacks that can carry almost any item, but wind up being rather heavy in the process. Bulk reduction kicks in at 500 total bulk stored, and gives you a flat 75% weight reduction for anything else stored inside. You can only carry one Gear Box at a time. Gear Boxes spawn in the wild ontop of any HDBackpack inventory with no owner (see menudef to change spawn chances).  

# Loadout Codes:
```
box (<- Gear Box).
box threshold 0...9999 (<- the amount stored before weight reduction kicks in),
box modifier  1...100  (<- the amount of bulk (in %) that reduced items weigh (ex, 100 * (modifier 25) = 25 bulk)).
```
